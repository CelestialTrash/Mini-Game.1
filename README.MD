# Project Description:

## Description:

### Dark Liminal Escape is an atmospheric puzzle game set in a mysterious and eerie  limbo. Players take on the role of a character trapped in a dark and foreboding hospital-like environment, filled with lurking dangers and unsettling enemies. The goal is to navigate through the darkness, using a lantern sparingly to reveal the path ahead and avoid detection by the enemies that are drawn to the light.

### As the player, you must carefully plan your movements, toggling the lantern on and off to find your way while evading enemies that react to the light. The environment is filled with ominous sounds and a chilling atmosphere, enhancing the sense of dread and urgency as you attempt to escape the limbo.
